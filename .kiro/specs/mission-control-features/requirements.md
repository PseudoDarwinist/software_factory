# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the complete Mission Control product workflow and business logic that transforms the Software Factory from a technical platform into a magical development experience. Building on the existing event-driven architecture with drag-to-define functionality, this feature implements the seven-stage product flow (Think â†’ Define â†’ Plan â†’ Build â†’ Validate â†’ User â†’ Learn) with intelligent agents, context-aware AI, and automated workflow orchestration.

The system will provide the business rules, agent behaviors, and user experience flows that make software development feel effortless and intelligent, moving projects automatically from initial Slack message to shipped code with human oversight at key decision points.

## Core Implementation Principles

**Event Envelope Format:** All Redis events must use a standardized envelope with `{id, timestamp, correlation_id, event_type, payload}` structure for consistent processing and audit trails.

**Event Persistence:** Every event must be inserted into the Postgres event_log table before Redis publication to guarantee replay capability and audit compliance.

**Context-Aware AI:** All Claude-Code and Goose calls within Define and Build agents must include results from pgvector similarity queries to provide relevant project context.

**Metrics Collection:** Each agent must increment Prometheus counters for success/failure events using event_type as label for comprehensive monitoring.

## Requirements
