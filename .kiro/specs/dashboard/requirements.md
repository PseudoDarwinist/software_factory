# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The System Monitoring Dashboard is a comprehensive real-time monitoring interface that provides complete visibility into the Software Factory platform. This dashboard will be integrated into the Mission Control application as a Settings page, displaying metrics, events, agent status, and system health in a professional monitoring interface similar to enterprise DevOps dashboards.

The dashboard addresses the critical need for operational visibility, debugging capabilities, and proactive monitoring of the event-driven agent system that powers the Software Factory platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-Time Event Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor all events flowing through the system in real-time, so that I can verify integrations are working and debug issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display a live feed of all events (slack.message.received, idea.captured, etc.)
2. WHEN an event occurs THEN the dashboard SHALL update within 1 second via WebSocket
3. WHEN I click on an event THEN the system SHALL show the complete event payload and metadata
4. WHEN I filter by event type THEN the system SHALL show only matching events in real-time
5. IF the event stream exceeds 100 events/minute THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or throttling
6. WHEN I search for events THEN the system SHALL support filtering by content, type, project, time range, and agent
7. WHEN receiving real-time updates THEN the system SHALL send messages on WebSocket topic monitor.events in the same JSON envelope used on the Redis bus

### Requirement 2: Agent Performance Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor the status and performance of all agents (Capture, Define, Build, etc.), so that I can ensure they are processing events efficiently and identify bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display a grid showing all registered agents
2. WHEN an agent status changes THEN the system SHALL update the display with color-coded indicators (green/yellow/red)
3. WHEN I view agent metrics THEN the system SHALL show processing times, success rates, queue depths, and throughput
4. WHEN an agent fails THEN the system SHALL display error details and last known status
5. IF I have admin permissions THEN the system SHALL allow me to start/stop/restart agents
6. WHEN I select an agent THEN the system SHALL show historical performance charts and trends
7. WHEN performing manual agent actions THEN the system SHALL publish admin.agent.restart events so the audit trail stays intact

### Requirement 3: System Health Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor the health of all system components (database, Redis, WebSocket, APIs), so that I can proactively address issues before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display overall system health score and component status
2. WHEN a component becomes unhealthy THEN the system SHALL update status indicators and trigger alerts
3. WHEN I view system metrics THEN the system SHALL show database performance, Redis memory usage, and API response times
4. WHEN resource usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL display warnings and recommendations
5. IF the system detects performance degradation THEN the system SHALL log alerts and notify administrators
6. WHEN I configure alert thresholds THEN the system SHALL save settings and apply them to monitoring
7. WHEN exporting raw metrics THEN the system SHALL expose a /metrics Prometheus endpoint for scrape-based collection

### Requirement 4: Integration Status Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor the status of all external integrations (Slack, GitHub, AI services), so that I can quickly identify and resolve integration failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display status of all external service integrations
2. WHEN an integration fails THEN the system SHALL show error details and last successful connection time
3. WHEN I view integration metrics THEN the system SHALL show success rates, response times, and API usage
4. WHEN API rate limits are approached THEN the system SHALL display warnings and usage statistics
5. IF an integration is down THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guidance and retry options
6. WHEN integration status changes THEN the system SHALL log events and update displays in real-time

### Requirement 5: Historical Analytics and Reporting

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to analyze historical system performance and usage patterns, so that I can make informed decisions about capacity planning and feature development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a time range THEN the system SHALL display historical charts for events, performance, and usage
2. WHEN I view analytics THEN the system SHALL show trends for event volumes, processing times, and success rates
3. WHEN I generate reports THEN the system SHALL allow export to CSV/JSON formats
4. WHEN I analyze patterns THEN the system SHALL provide insights on peak usage times and bottlenecks
5. IF I need detailed analysis THEN the system SHALL support drill-down from summary to detailed views
6. WHEN I configure retention THEN the system SHALL manage historical data storage and cleanup
7. WHEN storing time-series data THEN the system SHALL keep high-resolution data for 7 days then down-sample or delete, configurable per environment

### Requirement 6: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a user of the monitoring dashboard, I want an intuitive and responsive interface that works on desktop and mobile, so that I can monitor the system from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the dashboard THEN the system SHALL load within 2 seconds and display in the Mission Control Settings page
2. WHEN I use mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive layout with touch-friendly controls
3. WHEN I customize the layout THEN the system SHALL allow resizing panels and saving preferences
4. WHEN I navigate the interface THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual hierarchy and professional styling
5. IF I need accessibility THEN the system SHALL support keyboard navigation and screen readers
6. WHEN I use the dashboard THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent design with the existing Mission Control interface
7. WHEN displaying the UI THEN the system SHALL reuse Mission Control dark theme palette and grid outlines so users instantly recognise it as part of the product
8. WHEN accessing the monitoring page THEN the system SHALL require the admin or observability role; bearer token must travel on the WebSocket upgrade request

### Requirement 7: Alert and Notification System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to receive alerts when critical issues occur, so that I can respond quickly to system problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL trigger immediate alerts with severity levels
2. WHEN I configure alerts THEN the system SHALL allow setting custom thresholds for all monitored metrics
3. WHEN alerts are triggered THEN the system SHALL display notifications in the dashboard and log alert history
4. WHEN I acknowledge alerts THEN the system SHALL track acknowledgment and prevent duplicate notifications
5. IF alerts require escalation THEN the system SHALL support escalation rules and external notifications
6. WHEN I review alerts THEN the system SHALL provide alert history, trends, and resolution tracking
7. WHEN resolving alerts THEN a critical alert is considered resolved when the monitored metric returns below threshold for one full sampling window OR a user clicks 'resolve'

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the monitoring dashboard to have minimal impact on system performance while handling high event volumes, so that monitoring doesn't degrade the system being monitored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard is active THEN the system SHALL use less than 5% additional CPU and memory resources
2. WHEN processing high event volumes THEN the system SHALL handle 1000+ events per minute without performance degradation
3. WHEN multiple users access the dashboard THEN the system SHALL support concurrent access without slowdown
4. WHEN displaying real-time data THEN the system SHALL implement efficient data streaming and caching
5. IF system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade features while maintaining core functionality
6. WHEN storing metrics data THEN the system SHALL implement efficient data retention and cleanup policies
