# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves a comprehensive architectural simplification of the current software factory project. The existing system uses an overly complex multi-server architecture with Flask (Python), Express (Node.js), and separate worker processes, connected via Socket.IO events. This creates debugging nightmares, deployment complexity, and reliability issues. The goal is to consolidate everything into a single, unified Flask application that maintains all functionality while dramatically reducing system complexity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single-process application startup, so that I can run the entire system with one command instead of managing multiple servers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `python app.py` THEN the system SHALL start all functionality in a single process
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL serve on only one port (8000)
3. WHEN I stop the application THEN all functionality SHALL terminate cleanly
4. IF the application crashes THEN no orphaned processes SHALL remain running

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unified logging and debugging, so that I can troubleshoot issues from a single log stream instead of checking multiple processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any system component logs information THEN it SHALL appear in the main application log
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the full stack trace SHALL be available in one location
3. WHEN debugging THEN I SHALL be able to set breakpoints that work across all functionality
4. WHEN monitoring the system THEN all metrics SHALL be available from a single endpoint

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simplified data management, so that I can have a single source of truth instead of managing multiple data stores.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is stored THEN it SHALL use a single SQLite database
2. WHEN data is updated THEN it SHALL use atomic transactions to prevent race conditions
3. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL automatically create/migrate the database schema
4. WHEN querying data THEN it SHALL use proper ORM relationships instead of manual JSON parsing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable communication between frontend and backend, so that I don't lose events or have synchronization issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend needs updates THEN it SHALL use simple HTTP polling instead of Socket.IO
2. WHEN background jobs run THEN their status SHALL be queryable via REST API
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the frontend SHALL gracefully handle polling failures
4. WHEN multiple clients connect THEN they SHALL receive consistent data without event conflicts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want background job processing within the main application, so that I don't need separate worker processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a repository needs processing THEN it SHALL use Python threading within the main process
2. WHEN background jobs run THEN their progress SHALL be trackable via database status
3. WHEN jobs complete THEN they SHALL update the database atomically
4. WHEN the application shuts down THEN background jobs SHALL complete gracefully or be resumable

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all AI integrations consolidated, so that I have consistent interfaces and error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI services are called THEN they SHALL use unified Python interfaces
2. WHEN AI operations fail THEN they SHALL have consistent error handling and retry logic
3. WHEN AI responses are processed THEN they SHALL be stored in the unified database
4. WHEN multiple AI services are used THEN they SHALL share common configuration and logging

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simplified deployment, so that I can deploy the entire system as a single unit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying THEN it SHALL require only Python dependencies (no Node.js)
2. WHEN containerizing THEN it SHALL use a single Docker container
3. WHEN configuring THEN it SHALL use environment variables for all settings
4. WHEN scaling THEN it SHALL support multiple instances with shared database

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing functionality preserved, so that the simplification doesn't break current features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using project management features THEN they SHALL work identically to the current system
2. WHEN processing repositories THEN system maps SHALL be generated with the same quality
3. WHEN using AI features THEN they SHALL provide the same capabilities as before
4. WHEN accessing the frontend THEN the user interface SHALL maintain the same functionality

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved system performance, so that operations complete faster without the overhead of inter-process communication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing operations THEN they SHALL complete in under 2 seconds for typical tasks
2. WHEN processing repositories THEN it SHALL be faster than the current multi-process approach
3. WHEN serving static files THEN it SHALL have minimal latency
4. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN it SHALL maintain responsive performance

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want maintainable code organization, so that the consolidated system remains clean and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing code THEN it SHALL use clear separation between API routes, services, and models
2. WHEN adding new features THEN they SHALL follow consistent patterns and conventions
3. WHEN testing THEN it SHALL support unit tests for individual components
4. WHEN extending functionality THEN it SHALL have clear interfaces and documentation
