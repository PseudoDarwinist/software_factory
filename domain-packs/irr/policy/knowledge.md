# IRR domain knowledge

- Cancellation events should use the IRR cancellation templates for clarity and compliance.
- Delay events often require concise SMS messaging; when delay is overnight and â‰¥ 4 hours, include hotel voucher guidance.
- Rebooking messages should clearly present new itinerary details; prefer email + SMS together for high-impact disruptions.
- Scheduled change communications should avoid alarming language and include self-service re-accommodation links where available.
