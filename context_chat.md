Great question! The context chat window on your Think stage is like a built-in AI assistant that helps you interact with context in real time while you’re evaluating ideas.

Here’s what it is for — in plain English:

Let’s say you’re looking at an idea:

“Scrape Gmail of the users to parse their bookings.”

The context panel already shows related items:
	•	Similar features from before
	•	Who worked on them
	•	Relevant code modules

But sometimes you want to ask questions or dig deeper without switching tabs or digging through files. That’s where the chat window comes in.

What you can do with it (real-world examples):
	•	Ask follow-ups like:
“What was the last time we built something similar?”
“Who implemented the Gmail parser before?”
“Do we have test coverage for this kind of parsing?”
	•	Refine the idea before moving it to Define stage:
“Can you rewrite this idea as a user story?”
“What permissions would we need for Gmail scraping?”
“Are there any legal issues I should know?”
	•	Explore deeper context:
“Show me the related code in the user-management module.”
“Is this feature related to any recent bugs?”

⸻

Why it’s helpful:
	•	You don’t need to leave the page or open another tool.
	•	It’s context-aware — it already sees the idea you selected and the related info from vector DB, graph DB, etc.
	•	It’s like having a smart teammate sitting next to you who’s already done their homework.

In short: the context chat helps you refine, validate, and understand ideas better before committing time and energy to Define or Plan. It reduces guesswork and speeds up decision making.
