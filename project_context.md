No you dint understand, we can obviously build these later  — 

1.Change management, not features, is the real hurdle
2 — Security, compliance and fine-grained roles are only sketched
3 — Reporting and portfolio views are missing
 but its not about build but it's not about building this and adding these features, which makes it enterprising. What I'm talking about is the silliness of the whole idea that we are doing right now. Which is, somebody talks about an idea in a Slack channel, it comes to our mission control, but then it doesn't have the context of the application. Right, what I mean is let me explain to you with an example.

Right now, we are saying "OK, add a background" but add a dark background. Now it comes to our UI and then you know it goes through the define phase. Define has only five fields and all that, but that's not how it works in enterprises. For example, I work for an application which is a travel disruption communication platform. It sends communications to all the disrupted passengers on a flight in the form of email and SMS. So, and it has integrations to booking platform and other legacy applications of my enterprise that sets the contact context to build the email and SMS. But right now, if I use this application to build you know, add new features to that application, and somebody writes, "Can we add another event to you know, can we add another event to our flight disruption platform?" And it comes to our UI build. Will the UI have any context? What is that user talking about? That's what I mean. Meaning, our platform doesn't have the context of the application that we're talking about. So if you know, let's say, if right from the onset, our project has the context that this is an application of our travel disruption communication or it is connected to the Github repo, and the agent has the entire context of our application. So when this card comes, like, "Okay, add a new event" - so that when we are in the defined phase, the agent already knows, "This is a this is a disruption platform", and when the user says, "Add a new event", that means they are talking about a new event called whatever user is saying. Add a new event of gate change, so when the gate changes we have to send communication to our customer. Right, so the AI knows that user's message of adding a new event called "gate change". What does it mean? It means we are trying to add a new event which will send communication to customers in the form of emails and SMS.

And then when we drag that into the define phase, the agent builds the PRD, BRD, which is what we deal in enterprise. User stories, construct user stories in the UI. But right now we have 5 fields. Do you think a product owner will only define these 5 fields and just drag it and then the planning building phase starts? Do you think that's what happened in industry? So, how do we make it more enterprising right from the start? How do we give it the context of the application? How do we build a robust define-build-think phase? 

Answer:Let us rebuild the story from the ground up but this time with the right amount of “enterprise gravity.”
You will see how the platform can carry deep application context, how the Define room grows into a genuine BRD / PRD workspace, and how every later stage keeps using that context.

⸻

1.  Give the platform context before the first idea arrives

When a company on-boards a project it walks through an ingestion wizard – a short setup that loads the knowledge the agents will need later.
	•	Step one connects the Git repository (or several).
The wizard scans the code base, reads the module tree, notes package names, OpenAPI files, database migration files, and any existing tests.
It stores the results in the graph as a first-cut “system map.”
	•	Step two asks for reference documents.
The admin drags in the latest BRD, an architectural decision log, and maybe an internal FAQ.
The Capture service chunks those PDFs and pushes them into a search index so the LLM can quote them later.
	•	Step three links collaboration channels.
#travel-ops in Slack is mapped to the Travel disruption messenger project; #payments_feature_requests is mapped to the Payments project, and so on.

After that three-minute ritual the platform already “knows” that the travel project sends e-mails and SMS when flights cancel and that the code lives in messenger-service/ and template-service/.

No idea card will appear without that background ever again.

⸻

2.  A realistic enterprise idea lands

A support lead writes in the mapped Slack channel:

“We need a new event: gate-change, send SMS and email in the local language.”

Capture pulls the message and looks at the project map.
Because the project owns the messenger code and because the system map says “supported event types = [delay, cancellation, rebooking],” the agent immediately enriches the raw text:
	•	entity detected: event type
	•	current gap: event not in enum list
	•	down-stream impact: template service, localisation rules, metrics dashboard

That extra metadata is stored on the Idea node before the card even reaches Mission Control.

⸻

3.  Dragging the idea into Define now feels grown-up

When the product owner drags the gate-change card onto Define, the bigger context pays off.

The Product Brief template is no longer five toy fields.
The agent fills in real enterprise sections:
	•	Business goal – reduce airport chaos complaints.
	•	Scope boundaries – affects only outbound communications, not inbound confirmations.
	•	Dependant systems – booking engine, customer-profile API, SMS vendor gateway.
	•	Regulatory flags – must meet EU GDPR for PII, must support language fallback.
	•	Backward-compatibility risk – template cache pre-warm needed.
	•	User stories – four stories covering SMS, e-mail, localisation and monitoring.

The draft also includes the list of existing event types, the location in code where the enum lives, and links to the template repository.  All of that came from the ingestion step.

The product owner edits, adds real numbers (expected message volume, SLA), and then freezes the spec.

⸻

4.  Planner turns a serious spec into real tasks

Because the spec now names “template-service” and “localisation-rules,” the Planner does more than guess.
It reads the code map and creates tasks mapped to paths:
	•	add GATE_CHANGE to EventType.java in messenger-service
	•	generate English, French, German templates in template-service
	•	extend localisation table in localisation-rules
	•	add Grafana alert for gate-change failure rate

Owners are chosen by commit history in each path.
Story points reflect the historical median for files under that folder.
Nothing feels toy-size.

⸻

5.  Build drawer shows context-aware suggestions

When a developer opens the task “add enum value,” the drawer shows:
	•	the exact line in EventType.java where the new constant belongs,
	•	a code patch from the chosen assistant (Priya uses Claude-Code) that inserts GATE_CHANGE,
	•	a unit test stub using the project’s in-house test helper, not a generic one.

The assistant knew about the helper because the ingestion phase indexed the test directory and the prompt included “follow the TestUtils pattern.”

⸻

6.  Validate room runs domain-specific checks

The Test agent does not just run generic Jest or JUnit.
It looks at the system map, sees a Postman collection for the messenger API, and runs those contract tests too.
It also calls the SMS sandbox endpoint to ensure the new template renders in French.
Results flow back into Validate with green ticks only when the real integration passes.

⸻

7.  How to grow the Define room spec without drowning users

Enterprises differ, so the Product Brief template is configuration, not code.
During onboarding the admin chooses which headings are mandatory.
Security teams can inject a “Data-classification” section.
Finance can add “Estimated cost impact.”
Those headings show up as red until filled.
The agent can offer starter text, but humans review.

⸻

8.  In short, making it “enterprise” is not about more buttons

It is about feeding the agents enough truth that every suggestion is grounded in the company’s own code, vocabulary and compliance rules.
	•	The ingestion wizard gives the knowledge.
	•	The graph stores relationships so ideas carry context.
	•	The template system lets each domain demand its own sections.
	•	The Planner leans on repository history to assign real owners.
	•	The BYO assistants use prompts that include system-map excerpts, so their patches fit the house style.

With those pieces in place the flow no longer feels like a toy checklist.
A gate-change event request goes from chat to production with every enterprise subtlety honoured, and the product owner can point auditors to one brief that links requirement, code changes, tests and deployment in a single trace.

That is what will make teams use it—and keep using it—because it removes meetings and hushes compliance scares, not because it drags cards on a screen.

Ok lets work on the first idea:Give the platform context before the first idea arrives
I dnt want to reinvent the wheel with Agent. Can i use bring your own assistant here with Claude Code. I think Goose can use Claude code via Claude code sdk or we can directly use Claude code(CC) SDk. CC can read the repo, index it, user can talk to the  CC about repo, feed it enterprise context inform of docs etc,lets keep our chat shorter and not be very verbose but in plain english.
https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/cli-providers/

Yes—you can load deep project context with Claude Code through Goose and skip inventing a new “ingestion agent.”
Here is the tightest way to do it.

⸻

1  Install and wire Claude Code into Goose

# 1. install the Claude CLI (only once)
npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude

# 2. point Goose at that CLI
export GOOSE_PROVIDER=claude-code     # tells Goose to act as a wrapper
goose configure                       # pick “Claude Code” and the default model

Goose will now treat every goose session as a Claude Code session under the hood.  ￼

⸻

2  Run a one-shot “index my repo” recipe

# inside the root of messenger-service/
goose recipe github-index \
  --repo-path . \
  --out system-map.json

	•	Goose streams the file tree to Claude Code.
	•	Claude walks each directory, summarises modules and detects enums, APIs, tests.
	•	The JSON map lands in system-map.json—ready to push into your graph DB.

⸻

3  Feed enterprise docs the same way

goose recipe doc-index \
  --docs-path docs/          # PDFs, ADRs, runbooks
  --out knowledge-chunks.json

The output is a list of clean text chunks with titles and source links.  Store those in the same graph or a search index.

⸻

4  Expose one backend route for the UI

POST /api/context/ingest
Body:

{
  "repoPath": "...",
  "docsPath": "...",
  "projectId": "travel-messenger"
}

Your service simply shells out to the two Goose recipes above, then saves the system-map.json and knowledge-chunks.json under that projectId.  No extra AI code required.

⸻

5  Let users chat with the context immediately

In the Mission Control sidebar add a “Chat with code” button.
On click:
	1.	POST /api/context/chat with the user’s prompt.
	2.	The server runs

goose session --loader project=travel-messenger

Feeding Claude Code both the system map and the doc chunks as context loaders.

	3.	Stream Claude’s reply back to the UI.

Because Claude Code supports up-to-200k tokens, you can fit substantial repos plus docs in one request.

⸻

6  When a new idea arrives the agents already “know”

The Capture service tags the idea with projectId.
When the Define agent asks Claude to draft the Product Brief it simply adds:

“Context: see system-map and docs for project travel-messenger.”

Claude’s answer now references real enums like GATE_CHANGE, real services like template-service, and real compliance notes copied from your PDF.

⸻

7  No new agent, no wheel reinvented
	•	Goose gives you session management and recipes.
	•	Claude Code supplies long-context reasoning.
	•	Your backend only needs thin wrappers to run recipes and store their JSON.

That is enough to load enterprise context before the first idea card ever appears.

image.png

Here’s a mock-up of how “Add Project” can live right inside the Mission Control project rail:
	•	The existing project list stays visible in the background so users never feel they’ve left the hub.
	•	A centred modal guides three simple steps—choose repository, generate the system map, upload docs—matching the ingestion flow we sketched.
	•	An “Exit” button closes the modal without committing changes, keeping the workflow safe.

When the user completes step 3 the modal closes, the new project row appears in the left rail with a grey dot (“indexing”), and Mission Control starts streaming live health once the system map finishes building.
The little three-step modal in the picture is only the front door.
The real work starts as soon as the user finishes step 2 or presses Done at step 3.

⸻

What happens when the user clicks “Generate system map”
	1.	The browser sends one call to the backend:

POST /api/projects
{
  "name": "Travel Disruption Messenger",
  "repoUrl": "git@github.com:acme/messenger-service.git"
}


	2.	The backend saves a new row in Postgres and immediately places a message on the internal event bus:

event  project.created
{
  projectId: "p_messenger",
  repoUrl:   "git@github.com:acme/messenger-service.git"
}


	3.	The Ingestion agent is a head-less service that is already listening for exactly this message.
When it hears it, the agent:
	•	clones the repository into a temp folder;
	•	runs

goose recipe github-index --repo-path . \
                           --out system-map.json

which invokes Claude Code under Goose to read and summarise the repo;

	•	writes every class name, API route and enum into the knowledge graph;
	•	emits a second message:

event  project.indexed
{
  projectId: "p_messenger",
  status:    "ok"
}


	4.	Mission Control’s web-socket hears project.indexed and flips the grey dot that was next to the new project row to green (or amber if the agent detected failing tests).

Exactly the same thing happens for documentation: when the user drops PDFs into step 3 the browser uploads them, the backend emits project.docs.uploaded, and the Ingestion agent runs

goose recipe doc-index --docs-path /uploads/p_messenger

All this time the UI does nothing more than reflect state changes it hears over the socket.
The “agent action” is not a button; it is an automatic reaction to the project.created and project.docs.uploaded events.

So:
	•	Modal = collects repo and docs paths.
	•	POST /api/projects = tells the system a new project exists.
	•	Event bus = announces that fact.
	•	Ingestion agent = picks up the event, runs Goose + Claude Code, writes the system map, and shouts back that it is done.
	•	UI = changes the dot colour and starts showing health once the graph is populated.

That is how the agent is triggered—no extra click, no wizard page, just the event fired by the backend when the user finishes the form.


Already developed:


 Perfect! I've successfully implemented the "Add Project" modal feature. Here's a summary of what I
  built:

  The implementation follows the exact flow described in your project context document, providing
  enterprise-grade project onboarding that feeds the platform context before the first idea arrives. The
   modal is fully functional and ready to integrate with the Claude Code + Goose agent system for
  repository analysis and document indexing.

> How does everything work that you built now. Can you explain with a real world example.

⏺ I'll explain how the Add Project modal works with a real-world example based on the project context
  document.

  🏢 Real-World Example: Travel Disruption Platform

  Let's say you work for an airline and have a Travel Disruption Communication Platform that sends
  emails and SMS to passengers when flights are delayed, cancelled, or gates change.

  Before: The Problem

  - Someone in Slack says: "Can we add gate change notifications?"
  - This idea lands in Mission Control, but the AI has zero context
  - The AI doesn't know this is a travel platform, what events already exist, or how the system works
  - Result: Generic, useless responses

  After: With Add Project Modal

  Here's how the enterprise onboarding flow works:

  ---
  Step 1: Repository Connection

  User Action: Engineering Manager clicks "Add Project" in Mission Control

  Modal Opens: Navy blue glass-morphism modal with 3 steps

  User Enters:
  Repository URL: https://github.com/airline-corp/travel-disruption-messenger
  Project Name: Travel Disruption Messenger (auto-detected)

  Behind the Scenes:
  // Frontend sends to backend
  POST /api/projects
  {
    "name": "Travel Disruption Messenger",
    "repoUrl": "https://github.com/airline-corp/travel-disruption-messenger"
  }

  // Backend creates project and emits event
  io.emit('project.created', {
    projectId: "project_1703123456_abc123",
    repoUrl: "https://github.com/airline-corp/travel-disruption-messenger",
    name: "Travel Disruption Messenger"
  })

  ---
  Step 2: System Map Generation

  User Action: Clicks "Generate System Map" button

  What Happens:
  1. Ingestion Agent (running Goose + Claude Code) picks up the event
  2. Clones repository to temporary folder
  3. Runs analysis:
  goose recipe github-index --repo-path . --out system-map.json

  Claude Code Analyzes:
  - File structure: src/events/, src/templates/, src/integrations/
  - Event types: DELAY, CANCELLATION, REBOOKING (in EventType.java)
  - Services: messenger-service, template-service, booking-integration
  - APIs: Flight status API, SMS gateway, email service
  - Database: Passenger contact tables, flight schedules

  Generated System Map:
  {
    "services": ["messenger-service", "template-service", "booking-integration"],
    "eventTypes": ["DELAY", "CANCELLATION", "REBOOKING"],
    "integrations": ["sms-gateway", "email-service", "flight-api"],
    "databases": ["passenger-contacts", "flight-schedules"],
    "templates": ["delay-email.html", "delay-sms.txt", "cancellation-email.html"]
  }

  ---
  Step 3: Document Upload (Optional)

  User Action: Uploads enterprise documents:
  - Business_Requirements_Document.pdf
  - API_Integration_Guide.md
  - Compliance_Guidelines.pdf

  What Happens:
  // Documents processed by ingestion agent
  goose recipe doc-index --docs-path /uploads/travel-messenger

  Claude Code Extracts:
  - Regulatory requirements: GDPR compliance for passenger data
  - SLA requirements: SMS delivery within 2 minutes
  - Business rules: Multi-language support required
  - Integration details: Booking system API endpoints

  ---
  🚀 The Magic: Context-Aware AI

  Now when someone in the #travel-ops Slack channel writes:

  "We need a new event: gate-change, send SMS and email in the local language."

  Old Way (Without Context):

  AI: "I'd be happy to help! Can you provide more details about:
  - What system are you referring to?
  - What type of events do you currently support?
  - What does 'gate-change' mean in your context?
  - What languages do you need to support?"

  New Way (With Project Context):

  AI: "I understand you want to add GATE_CHANGE as a new event type to the Travel Disruption Messenger 
  system.

  Based on the system map, I can see:
  - Current events: DELAY, CANCELLATION, REBOOKING
  - Location: Add to EventType.java enum
  - Templates needed: gate-change-email.html, gate-change-sms.txt
  - Integration: Will use existing SMS gateway and email service
  - Compliance: Must support GDPR and local language requirements

  Would you like me to:
  1. Create the technical implementation plan?
  2. Generate the user stories for this feature?
  3. Draft the gate change message templates?"
